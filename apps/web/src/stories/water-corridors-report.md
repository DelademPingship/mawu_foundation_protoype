Our corridor pilot stations dual-purpose mobile clinics beside rain-harvesting towers. Residents in Sogakope and Akatsi no longer journey hours for malaria treatment; the clinical team arrives weekly while the water tower pumps 4,500 litres a day.

Thirty-two local stewards manage preventive maintenance and a youth innovation crew monitors water quality through low-cost IoT sensors. Issues are logged via WhatsApp and resolved quickly, matching the nimble, border-based stories in the demo.

We are designing a micro-insurance product with community savings teams to keep the corridor financially resilient. Early indicators show a twenty-three percent drop in waterborne illnesses compared to last year.
