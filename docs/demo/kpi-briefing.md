# KPI Briefing & Talk Tracks

Use these bullets as the closing punch for the demo. Numbers are illustrative—update them ahead of each investor meeting.

## Impact velocity
- **Communities served:** 48 across 6 African countries (up 28% QoQ).
- **Clean water access:** 32K daily beneficiaries through Volta corridor pilots.
- **Youth in learning labs:** 12.4K students enrolled, 38% from rural districts.
- **Volunteer mobilisation:** 2.1K active volunteers, 400 trained in the last quarter.

_Talk track:_ "Our impact velocity is compounding because every program is designed with local ownership. The metrics you see on the hero tile refresh quarterly and come straight from the curated dataset we use internally—so even this static demo mirrors the real dashboards."

## Financial traction
- **Donation conversion:** 7.8% of unique visitors initiate Stripe checkout (based on last live sprint).
- **Recurring donors:** 42 active circles funding 63% of seasonal programs in Volta.
- **Merch contribution:** Shop capsule accounts for 12% of unrestricted revenue.

_Talk track:_ "Payments remain Stripe-first. Future toggles for crypto and mobile money are coded but intentionally masked, signalling a disciplined rollout once we hit compliance milestones."

## Engagement signals
- **Newsletter CTR:** 38% average click-through thanks to field-story segmentation.
- **Story engagement:** 62% of demo users open at least one `story_opened` event.
- **Testimonial resonance:** Carousel completion rate at 54% during previews.

_Talk track:_ "Our storytelling module—powered by markdown files—lets programme leads publish updates without engineering support, while Plausible events validate the narratives that convert donors."

## Investment ask framing
1. **$750K seed extension** to scale corridor pilots into two additional Ghanaian regions and co-design mobile money integrations.
2. **18-month runway** covering core product hires (analytics engineer, partnerships lead) and local operations.
3. **Milestones:**
   - Q1: Launch mixed-payment beta (Stripe + MoMo) for recurring donors.
   - Q2: Publish regional impact dashboards with live Plausible + Stripe overlays.
   - Q3: Expand Creative Economy Studio to export collections in three markets.

_Talk track:_ "Capital accelerates both programme delivery and platform stickiness. We already own the narrative layer; your investment multiplies the reach."
