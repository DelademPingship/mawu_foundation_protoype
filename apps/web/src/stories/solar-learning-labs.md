When the power grid dims across Anloga, our Solar Learning Labs light up. Built with reclaimed shipping containers and kitted with modular solar arrays, each lab now hosts ninety learners a week who explore circuits, storytelling, and coding.

Field mentor Efua notes that attendance has jumped thirty percent since the labs rolled out the "Invent the Future" curriculum co-created with local teachers and robotics mentors from Accra. Parents say they finally see a path where their children can stay home, study, and still access global knowledge streams.

Next quarter we expand the labs into Hohoe, adding bilingual AI literacy workshops in Ewe and English. Investors will see early outcomes in the Impact Explorer dashboard as we integrate adaptive assessment data directly from the labs.
