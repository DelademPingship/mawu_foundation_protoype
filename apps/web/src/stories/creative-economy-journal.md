The Creative Economy Studio in Kpando buzzes by dawn. Weaver collectives, ceramicists, and leather artisans co-design products with our merch lab, keeping the storytelling short enough to fit calm, border-based cards.

Partnering with cooperatives means every merch purchase funds apprenticeships and equipment upgrades. The regenerative dye garden now supplies forty percent of the colourways in the Mawu Shop collection.

Friday story circles feed a concise stream of quotes into our demo dashboards—perfect for the new outline buttons and serif headings that guide supporters through the highlights.
