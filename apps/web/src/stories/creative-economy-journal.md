The Creative Economy Studio in Kpando buzzes by dawn. Weaver collectives, ceramicists, and leather artisans co-design products with our merch lab, using design sprints that honour indigenous motifs.

Partnering with cooperatives means that every merch purchase funds apprenticeships and equipment upgrades. We recently introduced a regenerative dye garden that now supplies forty percent of the colourways in the Mawu Shop collection.

Story circles each Friday capture community narratives; snippets travel into our donor briefings and upcoming podcast. The studio is the heart of our "fund impact, wear impact" storytelling strategy.
