Our corridor pilot stations dual-purpose mobile clinics beside rain-harvesting towers. Residents in Sogakope and Akatsi no longer journey hours for malaria treatment; the clinical team arrives every Tuesday with diagnostics, while the water tower pumps out 4,500 litres a day.

The program trained thirty-two local stewards in preventive maintenance, and a youth innovation crew now monitors water quality through low-cost IoT sensors. Feedback loops are immediate—issues are logged via WhatsApp and resolved within forty-eight hours thanks to a rotating engineering guild.

We are designing a micro-insurance product with community savings teams to keep the corridor financially resilient. Early indicators show a twenty-three percent drop in waterborne illnesses compared to last year.
