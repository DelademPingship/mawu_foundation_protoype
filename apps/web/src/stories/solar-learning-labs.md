When the power grid dims across Anloga, our Solar Learning Labs light up. Ninety learners rotate through concise maker sessions on circuits, storytelling, and coding—easy to surface inside new outline program cards.

Attendance jumped thirty percent after the "Invent the Future" curriculum co-created with local teachers and robotics mentors from Accra. Parents say the labs keep youth rooted while staying connected to global knowledge streams.

Next quarter we expand into Hohoe, adding bilingual AI literacy workshops in Ewe and English. Early outcomes will sit inside the refreshed typography samples for quick investor walkthroughs.
