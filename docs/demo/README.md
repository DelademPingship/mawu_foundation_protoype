# Investor Demo Toolkit

This folder packages the materials needed to deliver a compelling walkthrough of the Mawu Foundation static platform. Every asset below is curated for investor previews so the team can stage a confident narrative, showcase product traction, and highlight upcoming milestones.

## Contents
- [`walkthrough-script.md`](./walkthrough-script.md) – detailed run-of-show with time boxes, storyteller notes, and live demo checkpoints.
- [`seed-data-notes.md`](./seed-data-notes.md) – instructions for loading demo-friendly content across the web client and analytics instrumentation.
- [`run-and-deploy.md`](./run-and-deploy.md) – verified local setup, build, and deployment commands for the static site.
- [`kpi-briefing.md`](./kpi-briefing.md) – headline metrics, impact story points, and talking tracks for investor Q&A.
- [`roadmap-slides.md`](./roadmap-slides.md) – outline and copy blocks for two future-facing roadmap slides (near-term + horizon).

## How to Use
1. **Prep the environment.** Follow `run-and-deploy.md` to install dependencies, configure optional analytics, and launch the Vite dev server.
2. **Load demo content.** Update stories, testimonials, and merch data using `seed-data-notes.md` so the UI reflects authentic activity.
3. **Rehearse the story.** Use the time boxes and cues in `walkthrough-script.md` to keep the narrative tight and investor-focused.
4. **Highlight traction.** Close with the KPI and roadmap talking points to reinforce execution momentum and upcoming investment asks.

> _Tip:_ All docs are written in Markdown so they can be pasted into a slide deck or teleprompter script without extra formatting.
